# Pizza Sales Performance Analysis SQL & POWER BI Analysis | SQL & Power BI | 


   Solved a complete set of pizza sales analysis queries in MySQL and replicated the same results in Power BI, showcasing strong cross-platform data validation and reporting skills.

   Outcome: Demonstrated my ability to validate logic across platforms and build a reliable, insight-driven Power BI dashboard from raw SQL analysis.

üìäProject Purpose & Goals: 

The primary purpose of this project was to extract actionable insights from pizza sales data to inform business decisions and optimize operations. Key goals included understanding sales performance, identifying popular pizza types and sizes, and analyzing revenue distribution.

üìàBusiness Problem: 

The project aimed to solve questions related to pizza sales, addressing a lack of comprehensive data-driven insights into customer ordering patterns, revenue generation, and product popularity, which hindered strategic decision-making.

üìÖScope:

The project's scope encompassed analyzing a dataset containing pizza sales information to answer a range of questions from basic order counts and revenue to advanced metrics like percentage contribution and cumulative revenue over time. The project involved data integration and data modeling to connect relevant tables for analysis.
